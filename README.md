# CASWebsite

Material for the ChesMont Astronomical Society Website

The CAS Website is located at http://www.chesmontastro.org

The site is built with Wordpress and the Nisarg theme. This repo is designed to merely contain any important modifications
to the core Wordpress code, plugins utilized, or child theme. There is also a small change to the parent theme - 
essentially ending all auto updates to the theme itself, as such updates could break the site and therefore are to be
processed manually.

This website has been put together on behalf of CAS by David M. Clifton
